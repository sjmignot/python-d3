# D3 (d3.v5) in a Jupyter Notebook

This notebook provides guidelines for how to run d3 version 5 (d3.v5) in a jupyter notebook, allowing you to simultaneously take advantage of Python's stellar data manipulation libraries and JavaScripts visualization capabilities.

I was struggling to find the right environment to work on D3 visualizations. I hope that this notebook can be that: a place that allows clean and smooth transition between python preprocessing and d3.

This notebook relied heavely on Stefaan Lippen's [stellar article on the subject](https://www.stefaanlippens.net/jupyter-custom-d3-visualization.html). If you want to learn more on the subject, I highly suggest you check it out!
